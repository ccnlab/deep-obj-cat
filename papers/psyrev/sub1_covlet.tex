\opening{Dear Keith:}

Please consider our manuscript, {\em Deep Predictive Learning: A Comprehensive Model of Three Visual Streams}, for publication in {\em Psychological Review}.  The original document is in LaTeX, so we are submitting a PDF version.  This is a comprehensive paper on a comprehensive model of predictive learning in the visual system, and it is roughly 34k words long (including appendix, but excluding references) and has 291 references.  We believe the scope of the work justifies the length, but would certainly be receptive to reviewer comments for where to cut.

We have formatted the paper in this initial submission for the benefit of the reviewers, not the copyeditors, with the figures in place so they can be examined in the context in which they are discussed.  I personally find it extremely aggravating to constantly flip back to the end to see the figures, but if any reviewers would prefer the traditional copyediting format, it is easy to provide that.

\closing{Sincerely,}
