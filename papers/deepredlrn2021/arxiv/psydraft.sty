%% psychdraft.sty
%%      Stanford Psychology APA'ish style for papers.
%%      Modifications to Latex article style
%%      9/10/90 MAM & RLM,
%%
%%      5/7/92 by ROR to be single-spaced,
%%        (put doublespace in yourself if you want it)
%%
%%      Use this style to get APA formatted papers, with figures,
%%      tables, and footnotes integrated into the text.  If you are
%%      submitting a paper for publication to a journal requiring APA 
%%      format, use suapapub.sty.  That style floats all tables and
%%      figures to the end, and makes footnotes be endnotes, etc.
%%
%%      This style makes several important changes to LaTeX's article 
%%      style.  It is meant to be used as an optional style as follows:
%%              \documentstyle[?????]{article}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% doublespace.sty
%%      APA style submissions should be doublespaced.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% modified by ror, 5/7/92
% modified by jlm, 11/20/93 -- more stuff is doublespaced when
% doublespacing is in effect.
%
%\input doublespace.sty   optional -- changes everything

\@ifundefined{singlespace}{
        \newcommand{\singlespace}{} }%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% fancyheadings.sty
%%      Allows things like multi-line headers, running heads, etc.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\RequirePackage{fancyhdr}
%\input fancyheadings.sty

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Section headings
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The default is to handle 3 levels of sectioning.  APA heading styles
% change slightly depending on whether 3 or 4 levels of headings are
% used in a paper.  To use 4 levels of headings, specify (???) as a
% \documentstyle option.

% ROR 9/14/92:
% modified to change default section commands to section* versions,
% that also add table of contents entries, but still allow for
% explicit * entries that have to refer to the \psy version of the
% section command

% JLM: This now has four levels, section, subsection, subsubsection,
% and paragraph.  APA does not have anything corresponding to the
% subsubsection command here; it is just a smaller-font version of
% subsection and is listed in the toc at the right level.

% APA Level 1
% Section heading is large, centered
\def\psysection{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}
{3.5ex plus 1ex minus .2ex}{2.3ex plus .2ex}
{\large\centering}}

\renewcommand{\section}[1]{\psysection*{#1} \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{#1}}

% APA Level 2
% Subsection heading to large, italic, flushleft
\def\psysubsection{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}
{2.0ex plus 1ex minus .2ex}{1.0ex plus \parskip}
{\large\it}}

\renewcommand{\subsection}[1]{\psysubsection*{#1}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{#1}}

% APA Level 3
% Subsubsection is normalzize, italic, flushleft
% This extends APA style -- to follow apa standards just don't use
% subsubsection.

\def\psysubsubsection{\@startsection{subsubsection}{3}{\z@}
{1.0ex plus \parskip}{0.01ex plus \parskip}
{\normalsize\it}}

\renewcommand{\subsubsection}[1]{\psysubsubsection*{#1}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{#1}}

% APA Level 4
% paragraph is normalsize, italic, run-in

\def\psyparagraph{\@startsection{paragraph}{4}{\parindent}
{0ex}{-1em}
{\it}}

% doesn't seem to do anything:

\renewcommand{\paragraph}[1]{\psyparagraph*{#1}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{#1}}

\def\tableofcontents{\psysection*{Contents\@mkboth{CONTENTS}{CONTENTS}}
 \@starttoc{toc}}

% ROR 9/14/92:
% changed to allow for single-spaced toc (by setting \parskip in .tex
% file )

\def\l@section#1#2{\addpenalty{\@secpenalty} \addvspace{\parskip} \addvspace{.4em}
