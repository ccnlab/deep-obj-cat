# wwi3d

`wwi3d` does deep predictive learning of 3D objects tumbling through space, with periodic saccadic eye movements, providing plenty of opportunity for prediction errors.  **wwi** = *what, where integration*: both pathways combine to predict object -- *where* (dorsal) pathway is trained first and residual prediction error trains *what* pathway.

This is (an updated version of) the model described in:

# TODO:

* save weights and exit when done running -- right now seems to be just hanging?

* pretrain lip

* reps record..

* grunti interface with run comparison..
