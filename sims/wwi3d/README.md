# wwi3d

`wwi3d` does deep predictive learning of 3D objects tumbling through space, with periodic saccadic eye movements, providing plenty of opportunity for prediction errors.  **wwi** = *what, where integration*: both pathways combine to predict object -- *where* (dorsal) pathway is trained first and residual prediction error trains *what* pathway.

This is (an updated version of) the model described in:

# Install

See [Emergent Wiki Install](https://github.com/emer/emergent/wiki/Install) page for installation instructions -- basically you need install Go (e.g., `brew install go` on mac), then do `go build` in this directory.

Then, you need to get `CU3D100_20obj8inst_8tick4sac.tar` from this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Mi9aUlF1A3sx3JaofX-qzKlxGoViT86?usp=sharing), which has the 3D rendered movies that the network is trained on.  Install it as `images` in the directory where this code is.  For example:

```bash
$ tar -xf CU3D100_20obj8inst_8tick4sac.tar
$ mv CU3D100_20obj8inst_8tick4sac images
```

(we usually have it in a centralized place and create a symbolic link, which works on the cluster too..)

# Running

Just run the wwi3d executable that is built with the `go build` command.  You can see how it processes processes input patterns, etc.  It takes about 1 day to train across 32 processors on our older cluster (use `go build -tags mpi` to build with mpi support), so it would take about 16 days without MPI.  Threading has decreasing benefits but is quite efficient for 2 threads, which is what it is configured for.
