# Shape similarity expt results analysis

Overall strategy:

* Download raw data from MTurk / batch / results -- as a huge .csv file: `raw_full_data.csv` (not checked in!)

* extract key data (Input, Response) and anonymous subject number to `raw_data.csv`

* summarize data as 0 = left, 1 = right, so Resp col is mean proportion right, 1- = mean left

* add mean left for left pairs, mean right for right pairs in summary SimMat table

* that's it!
